# WaveFront-Algorithm
3D WaveFront Algorithm
This is a school project for my Intro to Robotics class, 
we were asked to implement the wavefront algorithm on a 3D world space containing 2 cubes and 2 spheres. 
This data is contained in a text file and is read into the program via this file. 
An obstacle free path from the specified starting point and goal point is written to a file by the program.
